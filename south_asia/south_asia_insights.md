## Employment-to-Population Ratio Over Time (1990–2023)

![Employment Ratio Trend](figures/employment_ratio_trend.png)

The employment-to-population ratio represents the percentage of a region’s total working-age population that is employed, providing a direct measure of overall labor market participation rather than unemployment alone. In South Asia, this ratio remains relatively stable from 1990 to 2023, fluctuating within a narrow range of approximately 50.4% to 53.9%. The late 1990s demonstrate a gradual rise in participation, reaching a peak around 1998–2000, followed by a prolonged decline throughout the 2000s and early 2010s. This downturn suggests consistent labor market pressures that may have entrance into the workforce during this period. After reaching a low point near 2014, employment participation begins a slow recovery, trending upward through the late 2010s and early 2020s. During 2020, a sharp decrease is seen likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic causing jobs to come to a halt. Post 2020, there is an encouraging overall increase in the employment ratio. Overall, the trend demonstrates that labor force participation in South Asia shifts gradually over time, reflecting slow structural changes rather than sharp cyclical movements.

## GDP Growth Trends Over Time (1990–2023)

![GDP Growth Trend](figures/gdp_growth_trend.png)

Average GDP growth in South Asia from 1990 to 2023 shows strong overall performance accompanied by notable volatility. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, growth remained consistently positive, generally ranging between 4% and 7%, reflecting a period of steady regional expansion. Several sharp fluctuations occur in the mid-2000s and around 2010, indicating sensitivity to global and regional economic conditions. The most dramatic shock appears in 2020, when GDP growth plunges sharply into negative territory, corresponding to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This contraction is followed by an particularly large rebound in 2021, highlighting the region’s rapid recovery as economic activity resumed. Although growth moderates after this rebound, the overall pattern reveals that South Asia exhibits both strong long-term growth potential and high sensitivity to global disruptions.

## Relationship Between GDP Growth and Employment Ratio

This scatter plot examines the relationship between annual GDP growth and the employment-to-population ratio in South Asia from 1990 to 2023. The near-zero correlation value (r ≈ 0.014) indicates that there is effectively no linear relationship between these two variables over the observed period. Points are widely dispersed across the x-axis without any clear upward or downward trend, showing that years of high GDP growth do not consistently correspond to increases in employment rates, nor do slow-growth years reliably predict employment declines. This suggests that economic expansion in the region does not automatically translate into proportional labor market improvements, potentially reflecting structural factors such as automation, informal labor markets, decreased access to education or training programs and population growth that cause GDP growth and employment to function distinctly.

## Joint Trends in GDP Growth and Employment Over Time

This combined time-series view highlights the differing responses of economic output and labor participation in South Asia. GDP growth exhibits sharp year-to-year volatility, including pronounced downturns during global crisis periods such as 2008 and especially 2020, followed by rapid rebounds. In contrast, the employment-to-population ratio changes far more gradually, showing smooth declines through the early 2010s and steady recoveries afterward rather than abrupt drops. Notably, the extreme GDP contraction in 2020 does not correspond to an equally dramatic collapse in employment, indicating that labor markets adjusted slowly relative to immediate economic shocks. This divergence suggests that employment levels in the region are influenced more by long-term structural forces such as education, training and labor market dynamics than by short-run economic fluctuations alone.
